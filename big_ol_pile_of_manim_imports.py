"""
I won't pretend like this is best practice, by in creating animations for a video,
it can be very nice to simply have all of the Mobjects, Animations, Scenes, etc.
of manim available without having to worry about what namespace they come from.

Rather than having a large pile of "from <module> import *" at the top of every such
script, the intent of this file is to make it so that one can just include
"from big_ol_pile_of_manim_imports import *".  The effects of adding more modules
or refactoring the library on current or older scene scripts should be entirely
addressible by changing this file.

Note: One should NOT import from this file for main library code, it is meant only
as a convenience for scripts creating scenes for videos.
